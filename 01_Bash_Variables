► Bash variables are used to store and manipulate data:
► They are valid within a shell session
► Variables can be defined and used directly in the shell session
► Data is then stored temporarily within the current shell session
► Syntax: variable_name=value for declaration and assignment
► No spaces around the = operator!
► Variables are case-sensitive
(myVar and myvar are different variables)
► Important:
► There are no data types, all variables in Bash are strings
► To access a variable:
► We can use variable expansion:
var='content'
echo "${var}"
